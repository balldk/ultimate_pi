# ultimate_pi

My first flutter, dart project, 100% shitty code but that's okay <3

I created [this react native pi training app](https://github.com/richie-south/pi-trainer) and wanted to do somthing similar in flutter so i took the same concept but added a points system with a way to build combos to earn lots of points! So now you can learn pi decimals in a competing way :D

Anyway you can [try the app here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.richardsoderman.ultimatepi)
